Sort Assignment

The project name is CSVSort, It is used to read csv file which contains list of array and it does custom sorting based on another csv file.

The main class which needs to be excuted is CustomCsvFileSorting.java where it reads input parameter as:

C:\CSVSort\src\main\resources\csv\product.csv 1 C:\CSVSort\src\main\resources\csv\sortingdef.csv 1

Please provide complete path of your csv files wherever you have stored you csv files. And csv file first column is considered at index 0.
Therefore column a will be 0, b will 1, and so on.

Please clone the repository at any folder. Then import the CSVSort Project into your favorite IDE. This project
also contains the csv file named product.csv and sortingdef.csv for your reference. If you wish to use the same, then go to that location 
where it is cloned and copy the complete path (For example, C:\CSVSort\src\main\resources\csv\product.csv if you have cloned it in C 
directory. Otherwise, If you are using IntelliJ, then you can copy the path after right click on product.csv and sortingdef.csv and provide 
that path in run configuration). Otherwise you can provide your own csv file from any folder, but provide the complete path of that csv files.

Then go to run configuration of your IDE, and provide the complete path and provide the column index which you want ot sort. if you want to
sort b column then provide index 1, and similarly for sort order definition file.
